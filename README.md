# About this project

This project was done to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScipt.
The goal was to create simple games to deepen my knowledge in the languages used for the Web.
Each game brought its share of difficulties, but being confronted with concrete projects allowed me to learn much more than during the online trainings.
